Since you’ve already decided to create a smaller branch called stats-page for the stats-related changes from the feat/http-and-stats branch, I’ll update the instructions starting from Step 4 of the previous workflow. I’ll assume you’ve completed Steps 1–3 (cloning your fork, adding the contributor’s remote, and checking out their branch). Here’s how to proceed with your stats-page branch:

Updated Steps Starting from Step 4
Create the stats-page Branch in Your Fork
Ensure you’re starting from the main branch of your fork, which is up to date with modelcontextprotocol/inspector’s main:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git checkout main
git pull upstream main  # Just to double-check it’s synced
Create the stats-page branch:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git checkout -b stats-page
Cherry-Pick or Manually Apply Stats-Related Changes
Switch to the contributor’s branch temporarily to inspect the changes:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git checkout feat-http-and-stats
git log main..feat-http-and-stats --oneline  # See the commits
git diff main feat-http-and-stats            # See the full diff
If the stats-related changes are in specific commits:
Switch back to your branch:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git checkout stats-page
Cherry-pick the relevant commits (replace <commit-hash> with the actual hash):
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
If the changes are mixed in a single commit or you need to isolate the stats part:
From stats-page, manually apply only the stats-related changes. For example:
Copy stats-related files or code from feat-http-and-stats into stats-page using your editor.
Or use git checkout to grab specific files:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git checkout feat-http-and-stats -- <path/to/stats-file>
Stage and commit the changes:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git add <stats-related-files>
git commit -m "Add stats page functionality from feat/http-and-stats"
Push the stats-page Branch to Your Fork
Push your stats-page branch to your fork on GitHub:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git push origin stats-page
Go to your fork on GitHub, and create a PR from stats-page to modelcontextprotocol/inspector’s main branch.
Verify and Test
Before submitting the PR, test the stats-page changes locally to ensure they work as intended:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
# Run any relevant tests or build commands for the project
If the stats feature depends on other changes (e.g., HTTP-related code), you may need to adjust your split or coordinate with the original contributor.
Optional: Create Additional Smaller Branches
If you plan to break out more features (e.g., the HTTP part), repeat the process:
bash

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
git checkout main
git checkout -b http-feature
# Apply HTTP-related changes from feat-http-and-stats
git push origin http-feature
Notes Specific to stats-page
Identifying Stats Changes: Since the branch is named feat/http-and-stats, the stats-related changes might be in specific files or sections of code. Use git diff main feat-http-and-stats to locate them (look for keywords like "stats," "statistics," or related UI/data logic).
PR Description: In your PR for stats-page, you could write something like:
text

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
Adds the stats page functionality extracted from QuantGeekDev/mcp-debug#feat/http-and-stats.
This is part 1 of splitting the original PR into smaller, focused changes.
Let me know if you need help isolating the stats-related changes from feat/http-and-stats or if you run into any issues pushing the branch!
